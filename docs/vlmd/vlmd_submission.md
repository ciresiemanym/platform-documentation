    Data dictionaries must conform to the HEAL [variable-level metadata schema](https://github.com/HEAL/heal-metadata-schemas/tree/variable-level-metadata/variable-level-metadata-schema). Please view our instructions on how to generate a HEAL-compliant data dictionary if you have not yet done so.

- Click on the study to open the Study Page 
- At the top of the Study Page, select `‘Submit a Data Dictionary’` to navigate to the **Data Dictionary Submission Form**.

- The `Study` field will already be filled in
- Choose the `Select File` button to browse your local computer for your data dictionary.

  - *Submissions should not include data of any kind.  Submissions containing data will be removed from the Platform.*      
- Enter a unique name for your data dictionary.  This name will be used to identify the data dictionary for users on the Platform. 
  - Previously submitted data dictionary names are displayed, if applicable - using the same name for a new submission will overwrite the existing record.
- To facilitate processing of your submission, some administrative information is needed to allow HEAL Data Platform staff to contact you should the need arise:
    - First and Last name
    - E-mail address
    - *Note that this information is not stored on the Platform, but is simply needed to support you throughout the submission process.*
