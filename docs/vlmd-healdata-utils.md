# How to Generate HEAL-compliant Data Dictionaries
Or, Using healdata-utils (or something expressing a utility) to Generate HEAL-compliant Data Dictionaries

In order to submit a data dictionary to the Platform, the data dictionary must conform to the HEAL variable-level metadata schema. This page will show you how to use a tool we’ve created (healdata-utils) to help you generate a HEAL-compliant data dictionary.  

!!! info
     A current version of Python will be required to run the HEAL Data Utilities (healdata-utils).

     Please see our python installation instructions for more help.

## Set Up a Virtual Environment

We highly recommend installing the HEAL Data Utilities in a virtual environment. There are several software dependencies that will be installed along with the healdata-utils; a virtual environment allows you to successfully install these packages without affecting other software already on your computer. You can learn more about creating virtual environments with Python [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).  

### Create a Project Folder

`mkdir my_project/`

`cd my_project `

### Create Input and Output Folders

`mkdir input`

`mkdir output`

### Create Virtual Environment

`python -m venv venv –upgrade-deps`

### Activate Virtual Environment

#### For MacOS and Linux:

`source venv/bin/activate`

#### For Windows:
`venv\Scripts\activate.bat`

If you would like to deactivate your virtual environment at any time, use the command:

`deactivate`

## Install the HEAL Data Utilities

Now that we’ve created and activated our virtual environment, we can install the HEAL Data Utilities.

`pip install healdata-utils`

Next, to confirm that the HEAL Data Utilities package was installed correctly:

`which vlmd`

The installation path should look like something like this:

`/Users/my_username/path_to_project_folder/my_project/venv/bin/vlmd`

## Generate a HEAL Data Dictionary

Now that the HEAL Data Utilities python package has been successfully installed, it can be used to generate a HEAL data dictionary. The command `vlmd` will be used to call the healdata-utils python package.

To confirm installation and to see the different options:

`vlmd --help`

Note that the only required flag is `--filepath`, the path to the file you want to convert to a HEAL data dictionary.

Here is how you would generate a HEAL Data Dictionary with a data dictionary downloaded from RedCap:

For MacOS and Linux:

`vlmd --filepath ./input/example_redcap_demo.redcap.csv --inputtype redcap.csv --outputdir ./output/heal-vlmd-from-redcap.csv`

For Windows:

`vlmd --filepath ./input/example_redcap_demo.redcap.csv --inputtype redcap.csv --outputdir ./output/heal-vlmd-from-redcap.csv`

## Summary of Command Line

1. `mkdir my_project`
2. `cd my_project`
3. `python -m venv venv`
4. `source venv/bin/activate`
5. `mkdir input`
6. `mkdir output`
7. Download Your Redcap.csv Data Dictionary into the my_project/input/ folder
8. `pip install healdata-utils`
9. `vlmd --help`
10. `vlmd --filepath ./input/example_redcap_demo.redcap.csv --inputtype redcap.csv --outputdir ./output/heal-vlmd-from-redcap.csv`
