Data Management and Repositories
--------------------------------

To help HEAL investigators in the repository selection process, the HEAL Data Stewards at RENCI/RTI have developed [Repository Selection Criteria](https://www.healdatafair.org/resources/guidance/selection) and identified a number of recommended repositories. A HEAL-compliant repository is a FAIR data repository that is NIH-supported and ideally has an API for metadata and data permissions calls.

The following is a non-exhaustive selection of repositories and resources currently made accessible through or leveraged by the Heal Platform:

Studies from different Data Resources can be filtered and selected on the [Discovery Page](platform_discovery_page.md) in the Study Filters section (top panel):
