# FAQs

1. What can I do on the HEAL Platform?  
      
    The HEAL Platform is a cloud-based and multifunctional web interface that provides a secure environment for discovery and analysis of HEAL results and data. Explore all functionalities [here](logging-in.md).  
      
    
2. Which datasets are currently open-access?  
      
    Find all open-access datasets [here](platform_request_access.md#current-open-access-studies).  
      
    
3. Where can I see individual study metadata?  
      
    Individual study metadata is shown upon clicking on a study entry on the Discovery Page. Click to read the full description [here](platform_discovery_page.md).  
      
    
4. Do I need to store my data in a particular location to participate in the HEAL platform?  
      
    You must store your data in a HEAL-compliant repository. A HEAL-compliant repository is a data repository that is NIH-supported and ideally has an API for metadata and data permissions calls.
    To help HEAL investigators in the repository selection process, the HEAL Data Stewards at RENCI/RTI have developed [Repository Selection Criteria](https://www.healdatafair.org/resources/guidance/selection) and identified a number of recommended repositories.
    If you have questions regarding costs associated with data storage in HEAL-compliant repositories, please contact the [HEAL Data Stewards](mailto:HEALstewards@renci.org).


5. How and where can I see if I have access to a study?  
      
    Clicking on an individual study on the Discovery Page will show in the top right corner if they are accessible to the user. To see all studies users have access to, users should navigate to the Discovery Page and select “Data Availability” - Available”. More information [here](platform_request_access.md).       
    
6. I do not have access to a specific study, how can I get access?  
      
    RENCI/RTI (Renaissance Computing Institute) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill establishes and manages data access contacts over all data contributors/sources. To request access to controlled data, users should contact RENCI/RTI at HEALstewards@renci.org.  
      
    
7. The profile page says I have access but I don’t see it on the Discovery Page.  
      
    Please contact our [help desk](mailto:heal-support@datacommons.io).  
    
  
8. I would like to download data files from a specific study, what do I need to do?  
      
    Users can download the studies directly from the Discovery Page as described [here](downloading_files.md#download-data-files-from-the-discovery-page), or, if the file size exceeds 250 MB, users need to use the Gen3-client command line tool to download data files, as described [here](downloading_files.md#download-data-files-using-the-gen3-client). Additional information on the Gen3-client may be found [here](https://gen3.org/resources/user/gen3-client/).

12. My download is not working.  
      
    Please check if your file size exceeds 250 MB. If yes, please other tools as described [here](downloading_files.md#download-data-files-using-the-gen3-client) to download the files. Note that the current studies that have datasets of more than 250 MB are those with the following project numbers: a) cdcwonder and b) deaarcos1. If errors persist, please contact the [help desk](mailto:heal-support@datacommons.io).  
      
    
13. My data file download using the Gen3-client gets stuck, where can I get help?  
      
    For troubleshooting, please see the Gen3-client documentation [here](https://gen3.org/resources/user/gen3-client/). If errors persist, contact our [help desk](mailto:heal-support@datacommons.io).  
      
    
14. The Gen3-client shows errors, where can I get help?
